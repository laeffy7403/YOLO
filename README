Before running this project, create a directory named dataset. Inside it, create two folders: images and labels.

dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── cat/
│   └── dog/
└── labels/

dataset → Main dataset directory

images → Contains subfolders for each object class (e.g., cat, dog)

labels → Automatically generated based on the images during labeling or training
